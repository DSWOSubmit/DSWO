# DSWO: Delaying Swaps When Overlapped

## Installation

DSWO uses modules from the Qiskit libraries [Qiskit Terra](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra).

### Experiment configurations

All the experiments in the paper can be reproduced via their JSON configuration files in `/exp_in`. The options are shown below:

| Field         | Description 
|:-             |:-
|`benchmark`   | Benchmark's name of the Exp.
|`exp_name` | Name of the Exp.
|`benchmark_path`    | File path to the directory where benchmarks are saved.
|`out_path`     | File path to the CSV file and QASM file generated by Exp. 
|`fit_scale`           | Whether the Exp use extend Heavy Hex lattice.
|`limitLength`         | Array of `SIZE_L` the Exp will use 
|`regenerate`    | Whether regenerate benchmarks this time.
|`round`         | The times run the SABRE and DSWO when taking the optimal value.

### Running an experiment

run `EXP.py` and add the path of JSON configuration file as a command line argument. For example, to run experiment of QAOA in 2D Grid and Heavy Hex:
```bash
$ python EXP.py ./exp_in/exp_qaoa.json
```
